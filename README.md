This extension can be used for multiple purposes such as:
1. For taking breaks at regular intervals during work :man_technologist:
3. Drinking water at regular intervals :cup_with_straw: (Most Important !)
3. As a basic timer for solving coding questions :writing_hand: (As it is basically a timer, so why not use it for coding ?)
